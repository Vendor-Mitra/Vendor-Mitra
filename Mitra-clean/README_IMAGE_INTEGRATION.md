# Auto-Image Integration for Product Management

## üöÄ Features
- **Automatic Image Fetching**: When suppliers type product names, images are automatically fetched from Unsplash
- **Smart Caching**: Images are cached to avoid repeated API calls
- **Fallback Support**: Different placeholder images for vegetables, fruits, and grains
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback while searching for images

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Get Your API Key Working!

**Currently, you're seeing placeholder images because the Unsplash API key isn't configured.**

### To Get Real Product Images:
1. **Get free Unsplash API key** from [https://unsplash.com/developers](https://unsplash.com/developers)
2. **Update** `src/config/api.js` with your key:
   ```javascript
   UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY: 'your_actual_key_here'
   ```
3. **Restart your app** - you'll see real product images!

## üìã Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Unsplash API Key (Free)
1. Go to [https://unsplash.com/developers](https://unsplash.com/developers)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new application
4. Copy your Access Key

### 2. Configure API Key
1. Open `src/config/api.js`
2. Replace `YOUR_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY_HERE` with your actual key:
   ```javascript
   UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY: 'your_actual_key_here'
   ```

### 3. Usage
- **For Suppliers**: Simply type a product name (e.g., "spinach", "apple", "tomato")
- **Auto-Image**: Image will be automatically fetched and displayed
- **Cache**: Subsequent searches for the same product use cached images

## üîß How It Works

### Image Fetching Flow
1. Supplier types product name in "Add Product" form
2. After 3+ characters, API call is made to Unsplash
3. Search query includes "food vegetable fruit" for better results
4. First matching image is selected and cached
5. Image preview is updated in real-time

### Caching System
- **Memory Cache**: Images stored in browser memory
- **API Call Reduction**: Same product names don't trigger new API calls
- **Performance**: Instant image display for cached products

### Fallback System (When API Key Not Configured)
- **Vegetables**: Get vegetable-specific placeholder image
- **Fruits**: Get fruit-specific placeholder image  
- **Grains**: Get grain-specific placeholder image
- **Others**: Get general food placeholder image

## üìä API Limits (Free Tier)
- **Rate Limit**: 50 requests per hour
- **Monthly Limit**: 5,000 requests
- **Image Quality**: High-quality images with various sizes

## üéØ Supported Product Types
- **Vegetables**: spinach, tomato, potato, cucumber, onion, carrot, etc.
- **Fruits**: apple, banana, orange, mango, grape, strawberry, etc.
- **Grains**: rice, wheat, corn, oats, barley, quinoa, etc.
- **Any Food Item**: The system searches with "food" context

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `src/utils/productImages.js` - Core image fetching utility with smart fallbacks
- `src/config/api.js` - API configuration
- `src/pages/SupplierDashboard.jsx` - Integration with add product form

### Key Functions
- `getProductImage(productName)` - Fetches and caches images
- `getCachedProductImage(productName)` - Gets cached images
- `getPlaceholderImage(productName)` - Gets appropriate placeholder based on product type
- `clearImageCache()` - Clears image cache

## üö® Troubleshooting

### No Images Loading
1. **Check if API key is configured** in `src/config/api.js` ‚Üê **Most Common Issue**
2. Verify internet connection
3. Check browser console for error messages

### Same Image for All Products
- **This means your API key isn't working!** Follow the setup instructions above
- The system is falling back to placeholder images

### API Rate Limit Exceeded
- Wait for the hour to reset
- Consider upgrading to paid Unsplash plan
- Images will fall back to appropriate placeholders

### Image Quality Issues
- Modify `IMAGE_QUALITY` in `src/config/api.js`
- Options: 'thumb', 'small', 'regular', 'full'

## üîÑ Future Enhancements
- **Multiple Image Sources**: Add Pixabay, Pexels APIs
- **Image Upload**: Allow suppliers to upload custom images
- **AI Enhancement**: Use AI to improve image matching
- **Bulk Import**: Import multiple products with auto-images

## üìû Support
If you encounter issues:
1. **First**: Make sure your API key is configured correctly
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify product names are descriptive (e.g., "red tomato" vs just "tomato")
4. Ensure you have internet connection

## üéØ Quick Test
1. Configure your API key
2. Go to Supplier Dashboard ‚Üí Add Product
3. Type "spinach" ‚Üí Should show spinach image
4. Type "apple" ‚Üí Should show apple image
5. Type "rice" ‚Üí Should show rice image
