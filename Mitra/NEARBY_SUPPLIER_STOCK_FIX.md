# Nearby Supplier Stock Fix

## Issue
When buying products from nearby suppliers in the cart, users were getting an "insufficient stock" error popup even though the products had stock available. This was happening because the cart's stock validation system couldn't find stock information for nearby supplier items.

## Root Cause
The `Cart.jsx` file had two problems:

1. **Stock Loading Issue**: The `loadStock()` function tried to fetch stock for nearby supplier items from `stockManager` or `supplierProducts` database, but these demo nearby supplier items don't exist in those databases. The stock information was already stored in the `item.stock` property when added to cart, but wasn't being used.

2. **Checkout Validation Issue**: The `handleConfirmOrder()` function tried to validate stock for nearby supplier items using `stockManager.checkAvailability()`, which would fail because these items don't exist in the stock manager database.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Stock Loading (lines 371-373)
Added a check for nearby supplier items to use their stored stock property:

```javascript
} else if (item.isNearbySupplier) {
  // For nearby supplier items, use the stock property from the item itself
  stockData[item.id] = item.stock || 100 // Default to 100 if not specified
}
```

### 2. Fixed Checkout Validation (lines 187-201, 209-222)
Updated stock validation to handle nearby supplier items separately:

**Stock Check:**
```javascript
for (const item of cart) {
  if (!item.isFlashSale && !item.isNearbySupplier) {
    // Regular stock check using stockManager
    const stockCheck = await stockManager.checkAvailability(item.id, item.quantity)
    // ...
  } else if (item.isNearbySupplier) {
    // For nearby supplier items, check against the stock stored in the item
    const itemStock = item.stock || 100
    if (item.quantity > itemStock) {
      alert(`Insufficient stock for ${item.name}. Available: ${itemStock}, Requested: ${item.quantity}`)
      return
    }
  }
}
```

**Stock Update:**
```javascript
for (const item of cart) {
  if (!item.isFlashSale && !item.isNearbySupplier) {
    // Only update stock for regular items
    stockUpdatePromises.push(decreaseStock(...))
  }
  // Note: Nearby supplier items don't need stock updates as they're demo items
}
```

## How It Works Now

### When Adding to Cart (SupplierFinder.jsx)
Products from nearby suppliers are added with:
```javascript
const cartItem = {
  id: `${selectedSupplierForProducts.id}_${product.name}`,
  name: product.name,
  price: product.price,
  image: product.image,
  supplier: selectedSupplierForProducts.name,
  quantity: 1,
  isNearbySupplier: true,  // Flag to identify nearby supplier items
  stock: product.stock || 100  // Stock information stored in the item
}
```

### In Cart Page
1. **Stock Display**: The `loadStock()` function checks if `item.isNearbySupplier` is true and uses `item.stock` directly
2. **Quantity Validation**: When changing quantity, it validates against `availableStock[item.id]` which now contains the correct stock value
3. **Checkout**: The checkout process validates nearby supplier items using their stored stock and skips the stock manager API calls

## Testing Steps

### Test Case 1: Add Product and View Stock
1. **Go to Supplier Finder page**
2. **Click "Get My Location"** to detect nearby suppliers
3. **Click "Show Products"** on any nearby supplier
4. **Observe the stock display** on each product (e.g., "ðŸ“¦ Stock: 150 kg available")
5. **Click "ðŸ›’ Add"** on a product with visible stock
6. **Go to Cart page**
7. **Verify the item appears** in "Nearby Supplier Items" section (blue header)
8. **Check stock display** - should show "(150 available)" next to quantity controls âœ…

### Test Case 2: Quantity Validation
1. **In Cart page**, find a nearby supplier item
2. **Note the available stock** (e.g., 150 available)
3. **Try to increase quantity** using the + button
4. **Keep increasing until you reach the limit**
5. **Try to go beyond the limit** - should show alert: "Only X items available in stock!" âœ…
6. **Manually type a quantity** greater than available stock
7. **Verify:** Alert appears preventing the change âœ…

### Test Case 3: Checkout Success
1. **Add multiple nearby supplier items** to cart
2. **Set quantities within stock limits** (e.g., 50 out of 150 available)
3. **Click "Proceed to Checkout"**
4. **Fill in delivery address** (e.g., "123 Main St, Mumbai")
5. **Select payment method** (COD, UPI, or Card)
6. **Click "Confirm Order"**
7. **Verify:** Order completes successfully without "insufficient stock" error âœ…
8. **Verify:** Success alert appears âœ…
9. **Verify:** Cart is cleared âœ…

### Test Case 4: Insufficient Stock Error
1. **Add a nearby supplier item** to cart
2. **In Cart page**, manually edit the quantity input field
3. **Enter a quantity greater than available stock** (e.g., 200 when only 150 available)
4. **Try to proceed to checkout**
5. **Verify:** Alert shows "Insufficient stock for [Product Name]. Available: 150, Requested: 200" âœ…
6. **Verify:** Checkout is prevented âœ…

### Test Case 5: Mixed Cart (Regular + Nearby Supplier Items)
1. **Add regular products** from Find Items page
2. **Add nearby supplier items** from Supplier Finder
3. **Go to Cart page**
4. **Verify:** Items are separated into two sections:
   - "Cart Items" (regular items with bargain option)
   - "Nearby Supplier Items" (blue header, no bargain option)
5. **Proceed to checkout with both types**
6. **Verify:** Order completes successfully for both types âœ…
