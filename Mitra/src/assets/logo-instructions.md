# Logo Setup Instructions

## Logo File
Save the Vendor Mitra logo image as: `logo.png` or `logo.svg` in this directory.

The logo should be the green handshake icon with "Vendor Mitra" text and tagline "Connecting Street Vendors & Suppliers".

## Current Implementation
The Navbar component has been updated to use the logo from this assets folder.

If the logo file is not found, it will fall back to the "VM" text logo.
