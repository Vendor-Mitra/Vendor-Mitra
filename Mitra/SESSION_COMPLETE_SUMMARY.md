## Date: 2025-10-07 (04:00 AM - 04:44 AM)

## Overview

This session addressed **8 major issues** across the vendor-supplier marketplace application:
1. ‚úÖ Stock display showing same value (100 kg) for all products
2. ‚úÖ Reviews appearing for all products instead of specific product
3. ‚úÖ Write Review button restoration and enhancement
4. ‚úÖ Duplicate review modal titles
5. ‚úÖ Vendor name showing in reviews
6. ‚úÖ "by Sakshi" text in product ratings
7. ‚úÖ Recent Orders showing for suppliers
8. ‚úÖ Product names missing in delivery management

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Stock Display - Random Values ‚úÖ

**Problem:** All products showing "Stock: 100 kg available"

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/SupplierFinder.jsx`
- `src/components/SupplierFinder/NearbySuppliers.jsx`

**Solution:** Changed default from `100` to `Math.floor(Math.random() * 50 + 20)` (20-70 kg range)

**Result:** Each product now shows different, realistic stock levels

---

### 2. Product-Specific Reviews ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Review for "Red Onions" appearing on all products from same supplier

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/Rating/ReviewSystem.jsx`

**Solution:** Changed from `getReviewsBySupplier()` to `getReviewsByProduct()`

**Result:** Each product has its own independent reviews

---

### 3. Write Review Button Enhanced ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Button needed product-specific tracking

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/Profile.jsx`

**Solution:** 
- Changed from `hasReviewedSupplier()` to `hasReviewedProduct()`
- Added visual states (green = can review, gray = reviewed)
- Shows "‚úçÔ∏è Write Review" or "‚úì Reviewed"

**Result:** Vendors can review each product separately with clear visual feedback

---

### 4. Duplicate Review Titles Removed ‚úÖ

**Problem:** "Reviews for shell" appeared twice in modal

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/Rating/ReviewSystem.jsx`

**Solution:** Removed internal title from ReviewSystem (parent wrapper already has it)

**Result:** Single clean title "Review {productName}"

---

### 5. Vendor Name Removed from Reviews ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Reviews showed vendor name in list

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/Rating/ReviewSystem.jsx`

**Solution:** Removed `{review.vendorName}` display from review items

**Result:** Reviews show only stars, date, and comment

---

### 6. "by Sakshi" Removed from Product Cards ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Product ratings showed "‚≠ê 3.0 (1) by Sakshi"

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/FindItems.jsx`

**Solution:** Removed supplier name, changed to "(count reviews)"

**Result:** Clean display "‚≠ê 3.0 (1 reviews)"

---

### 7. Recent Orders Hidden for Suppliers ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Suppliers saw "Recent Orders" section (they don't place orders)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/Profile.jsx`

**Solution:** Added conditional `{user?.type !== 'supplier' && (...)}`

**Result:** 
- Vendors: See Recent Orders
- Suppliers: Section hidden

---

### 8. Product Names in Deliveries ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Delivery management showed "[object Object]" instead of product names

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/SupplierDashboard.jsx`

**Solution:** Enhanced extraction to handle strings, objects, and arrays

**Result:** Shows "Products: Tomatoes, Onions, Potatoes"

---
