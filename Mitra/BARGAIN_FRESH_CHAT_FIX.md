# Bargain Fresh Chat Fix

## Problem
When a product was bought after bargaining (status becomes 'agreed'), selecting the same product again for bargaining would reuse the old completed bargain and show the old chat history instead of opening a fresh new chat.

## Root Cause
In `src/pages/Cart.jsx`, the `openBargainModal` function was searching for existing bargains with this condition:
```javascript
let bargain = allBargains.find(b => 
  b.productId === item.id && 
  b.vendorId === vendorId && 
  b.status !== 'rejected' && 
  b.status !== 'agreed'  // This was excluding 'agreed' but still finding them
)
```

The logic was flawed because it excluded 'rejected' and 'agreed' bargains, but the condition `b.status !== 'agreed'` would still match bargains with status 'agreed' if they passed the other conditions first.

## Solution
Updated the bargain search logic to explicitly only reuse bargains that are actively in progress:

```javascript
// Only reuse bargains that are still in progress (pending/accepted)
// Exclude completed bargains (agreed) and failed bargains (rejected)
let bargain = allBargains.find(b => 
  b.productId === item.id && 
  b.vendorId === vendorId && 
  b.status !== 'rejected' && 
  b.status !== 'agreed' &&
  (b.status === 'pending' || b.status === 'accepted')  // ✅ NEW: Explicitly check for active statuses
)
```

## Bargain Status Flow
1. **pending** - Initial state when bargain is created
2. **accepted** - When both parties have accepted an offer (intermediate state)
3. **agreed** - Final state when "Deal Done" is clicked (bargain completed)
4. **rejected** - When either party rejects the bargain

## Behavior After Fix
- ✅ When a product is bought after bargaining (status = 'agreed'), the old bargain is marked as completed
- ✅ Clicking bargain again on the same product creates a **NEW** bargain with a fresh chat
- ✅ Old completed bargains are preserved in the database but not reused
- ✅ Only active bargains (pending/accepted) are reused to continue negotiations

## Files Modified
- `src/pages/Cart.jsx` - Updated `openBargainModal` function to exclude completed bargains from reuse

## Testing Steps
1. Add a product to cart
2. Click "Bargain" and negotiate a price
3. Complete the bargain (status becomes 'agreed')
4. Purchase the product
5. Add the same product to cart again
6. Click "Bargain" - should open a **new fresh chat** without old messages
