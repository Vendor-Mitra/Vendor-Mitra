# Chatbot Recent Orders Navigation Fix

## Issues Fixed

1. **Recent Orders Navigation**: "open recent orders" command from vendor side was not navigating to the correct page
2. **Unwanted Context Messages**: Chatbot was displaying "(vendor side)" or "(supplier side)" in navigation responses

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Vendor Recent Orders Route
**File**: `src/components/Chatbot/Chatbot.jsx`

Changed vendor "recent orders" navigation from `/dashboard` to `/profile`:

```javascript
// Vendor side navigation map
'recent orders': '/profile',  // Was: '/dashboard'
'my orders': '/profile',      // Was: '/dashboard'
'orders': '/profile',         // Was: '/dashboard'
```

**Reason**: Recent orders are displayed in the Profile page (settings), not the dashboard.

### 2. Removed Context Labels from Navigation Messages
**File**: `src/components/Chatbot/Chatbot.jsx`

Changed navigation response from:
```javascript
return `Navigating you to ${keyword} (${context} side)...`
```

To:
```javascript
return `Navigating you to ${keyword}...`
```

**Reason**: Users don't need to be told which side they're on - it's implicit from their current location.

## How It Works Now

### Vendor Side
When on vendor pages, saying "open recent orders" will:
- Navigate to `/profile` page
- Show the "Recent Orders" section in the profile/settings page
- Display clean message: "Navigating you to recent orders..."

### Supplier Side
When on supplier pages, saying "open recent orders" will:
- Navigate to `/supplier-dashboard?tab=deliveries`
- Open the Deliveries tab showing supplier orders
- Display clean message: "Navigating you to recent orders..."

## Testing

### Test from Vendor Side
1. Go to any vendor page (e.g., `/dashboard`, `/find-items`)
2. Open chatbot
3. Type: "open recent orders"
4. **Expected**: Navigates to `/profile` page showing recent orders
5. **Message**: "Navigating you to recent orders..."

### Test from Supplier Side
1. Go to `/supplier-dashboard`
2. Open chatbot
3. Type: "open recent orders"
4. **Expected**: Opens Deliveries tab in supplier dashboard
5. **Message**: "Navigating you to recent orders..."

## Benefits

✅ Correct navigation to where recent orders are actually displayed
✅ Clean, professional navigation messages
