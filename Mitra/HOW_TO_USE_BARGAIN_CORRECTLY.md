## üîç Debugging Steps

If product is not showing in cart after bargaining:

### Check 1: Was Product Added to Cart First?
```
Open browser console (F12)
Go to Cart page
Check console for: "üì¶ Current cart items:"
```

### Check 2: Is Bargained Price Saved?
```
Open browser console (F12)
Type: localStorage.getItem('vendorMitraBargainedPrices')
Should show bargained prices
```

### Check 3: Is Product ID Matching?
```
In cart, check product ID
In bargain, check if same product ID
They must match exactly
```

### Check 4: Is Deal Status "agreed"?
```
Both vendor AND supplier must click "Confirm Deal Done"
Check bargain status should be "agreed"
```

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Bargaining Before Adding to Cart
**Wrong**: Click bargain from product page ‚Üí Product not in cart
**Correct**: Add to cart ‚Üí Go to cart ‚Üí Click bargain

### Mistake 2: Only One Party Clicks "Deal Done"
**Wrong**: Only vendor clicks "Confirm Deal Done"
