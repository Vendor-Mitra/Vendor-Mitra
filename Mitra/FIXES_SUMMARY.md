# Complete Fixes Summary

## All Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Nearby Supplier Stock Fix
**Issue:** "Insufficient stock" error when buying from nearby suppliers in cart.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/Cart.jsx`

**Changes:**
- Updated `loadStock()` to handle nearby supplier items using their stored `stock` property
- Updated `handleConfirmOrder()` to validate nearby supplier stock separately
- Skipped stock manager API calls for nearby supplier items (demo items)

**Result:** Nearby supplier items now properly validate stock and checkout successfully.

### 2. ✅ Order Summary Detailed Breakdown Fix
**Issue:** Order Summary showing generic "Cart Items (2 items)" instead of individual product details.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/BuyNow/BuyNowDialog.jsx`
- `src/pages/Cart.jsx`

**Changes:**

**BuyNowDialog.jsx:**
- Added `cartItems` and `bargainedItems` props
- Implemented conditional rendering for cart items vs single item
- Display each product with:
  - Product name
  - Quantity and unit
  - Price (with bargained price if applicable)
  - Individual total
- Show bargained prices with strikethrough original price
- Display total items count and total amount

**Cart.jsx:**
- Pass `cartItems={cart}` to BuyNowDialog
- Pass `bargainedItems={bargainedItems}` to BuyNowDialog

**Result:** Order Summary now shows detailed breakdown of all products with correct prices.
