# Debug Bargain Cart Issue - Step by Step

## 🔍 Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Check if Product is in Cart

1. **Add product to cart first**
   - Go to Find Items or Suppliers page
   - Add a product (e.g., Rice - 10 kg)
   - Click "Add to Cart"

2. **Open Browser Console** (Press F12)

3. **Check cart in localStorage**
   ```javascript
   // Run this in console:
   JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('vendorMitraCart'))
   ```
   
   **Expected**: Should show array with your product
   ```javascript
   [
     {
       id: 123,
       name: "Rice",
       price: 50,
       quantity: 10,
       supplier: "Sakshi",
       supplierId: 2
     }
   ]
   ```

4. **If cart is empty**, product was not added. Try adding again.

### Step 2: Start Bargaining

1. **Go to Cart page** (`/cart`)

2. **Check console for cart logs**
   - Should see: "useCart hook called, cart state: [...]"
   - Should show your product

3. **Click "Bargain" button** on the product

4. **Watch console for**:
   - "💬 Opening bargain for: Rice"
   - "✅ Created new bargain: {...}"
   - Should redirect to `/bargains?bargainId=...`

5. **Check if cart is still there**
   ```javascript
   // Run in console:
   JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('vendorMitraCart'))
   ```
   
   **Expected**: Product should STILL be in cart

### Step 3: Complete Bargain

1. **In bargain chat**, negotiate and accept

2. **Both parties click "Confirm Deal Done"**

3. **Watch console for**:
   - "✅ Saved bargained total amount: 450 for Rice"
   - "🔔 Bargain update event received"
   - "🔄 Cart updated with new bargained prices"

4. **Check bargained prices**
   ```javascript
   // Run in console:
   JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('vendorMitraBargainedPrices'))
   ```
   
   **Expected**:
   ```javascript
   {
     "123": {
       isBargained: true,
       bargainedPrice: 450,
       originalPrice: 500,
       quantity: 10,
       pricePerUnit: 50
     }
   }
   ```

### Step 4: Check Cart Again

1. **Go back to Cart page** (`/cart`)

2. **Check console**:
   - "📦 Current cart items: [{id: 123, name: 'Rice'}]"
   - Should show product is still there

3. **Check if product displays**:
   - Should see Rice in cart
   - Should show ~~₹500~~ ₹450
   - Should show "Bargained!" badge

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Product Not in Cart After Bargaining

**Symptom**: Cart is empty after clicking "Bargain"

**Debug**:
```javascript
// Check if removeFromCart was called
// Look in console for: "⚠️ CartContext: Removing item from cart"
```

**Solution**: 
- Check if you're accidentally clicking delete button
- Check console trace to see what's calling removeFromCart

### Issue 2: Bargained Price Not Showing

**Symptom**: Product in cart but price not updated

**Debug**:
```javascript
// Check bargained prices
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('vendorMitraBargainedPrices'))

// Check cart items
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('vendorMitraCart'))

// Check if product IDs match
```

**Solution**:
- Product ID in cart must match product ID in bargained prices
- Both vendor and supplier must click "Deal Done"

### Issue 3: Cart Cleared on Page Refresh

**Symptom**: Cart empty after refreshing page

**Debug**:
```javascript
// Check if cart is in localStorage
localStorage.getItem('vendorMitraCart')
```

**Solution**:
- Cart should persist in localStorage
- If empty, something is clearing it
- Check for logout or clearCart calls

### Issue 4: Event Not Firing

**Symptom**: Cart doesn't update after deal done

**Debug**:
```javascript
// Listen for event manually
window.addEventListener('bargainPriceUpdated', () => {
  console.log('✅ Event fired!')
})
```

**Solution**:
- Make sure both parties clicked "Deal Done"
- Check console for "🔔 Bargain update event received"
- Try refreshing cart page

## 🧪 Manual Testing Commands

### Check Everything at Once
```javascript
console.log('=== CART DEBUG ===')
console.log('Cart:', JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('vendorMitraCart') || '[]'))
console.log('Bargained Prices:', JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('vendorMitraBargainedPrices') || '{}'))
console.log('Bargains:', JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('vendorMitraBargains') || '[]'))
```

### Force Reload Cart
```javascript
window.dispatchEvent(new Event('bargainPriceUpdated'))
```

### Clear All Data (Fresh Start)
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('vendorMitraCart')
localStorage.removeItem('vendorMitraBargainedPrices')
localStorage.removeItem('vendorMitraBargains')
location.reload()
```
