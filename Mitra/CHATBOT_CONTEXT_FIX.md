# Chatbot Context-Aware Navigation Fix

## Problem
The chatbot was not respecting the current user context (vendor vs supplier side). When a user said "open recent orders" from the vendor side, it would sometimes navigate to supplier pages, and vice versa.

## Solution Implemented

### Changes Made to `src/components/Chatbot/Chatbot.jsx`

1. **Added Location Detection**
   - Imported `useLocation` from `react-router-dom`
   - Added `isOnSupplierSide` detection based on current pathname
   - Detects if user is on supplier side by checking if path starts with `/supplier`

2. **Context-Aware Navigation Map**
   - Converted static `navigationMap` to dynamic `getNavigationMap()` function
   - Returns different route mappings based on current context:
     - **Supplier Side**: All navigation commands route to supplier dashboard tabs
     - **Vendor Side**: All navigation commands route to vendor pages

3. **Enhanced Navigation Logic**
   - Updated `handleNavigationRequest()` to use context-aware navigation map
   - Added keyword sorting (longest first) to match more specific phrases first
   - Clean navigation responses without mentioning "vendor side" or "supplier side"

4. **Updated Contextual Info**
   - Modified `getContextualInfo()` to include current context in ChatGPT prompts
   - Provides appropriate feature list based on current side

## Examples

### Vendor Side Commands
When on vendor pages (e.g., `/dashboard`, `/find-items`):
- "open recent orders" → `/profile` (recent orders in profile/settings)
- "show products" → `/find-items` (browse products)
- "open bargains" → `/bargains` (vendor bargains page)
- "flash sales" → `/flash-sales` (vendor flash sales)

### Supplier Side Commands
When on supplier pages (e.g., `/supplier-dashboard`):
- "open recent orders" → `/supplier-dashboard?tab=deliveries` (supplier orders)
- "show products" → `/supplier-dashboard?tab=products` (manage products)
- "open bargains" → `/supplier-dashboard?tab=bargains` (bargain requests)
- "flash sales" → `/supplier-dashboard?tab=flashsales` (create flash sales)

## Key Features

1. **Automatic Context Detection**: No need for users to specify "vendor" or "supplier" in commands
2. **Consistent Navigation**: Same commands work on both sides but navigate to appropriate pages
3. **Clean Feedback**: Simple navigation messages without mentioning vendor/supplier context
4. **Intelligent Matching**: Longer, more specific phrases are matched first

## Testing

Test the following scenarios:

### From Vendor Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
- Say "open recent orders" → Should go to Profile page (where orders are shown)
- Say "show products" → Should go to Find Items page
- Say "open bargains" → Should go to vendor Bargains page

### From Supplier Dashboard (`/supplier-dashboard`)
- Say "open recent orders" → Should go to Deliveries tab in supplier dashboard
- Say "show products" → Should go to Products tab in supplier dashboard
- Say "open bargains" → Should go to Bargains tab in supplier dashboard

## Technical Details

- **Location Hook**: Uses `useLocation()` to track current route
- **Dynamic Mapping**: Navigation map is generated on-the-fly based on context
- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing chatbot functionality remains intact
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead, only adds one pathname check

## Benefits

✅ Prevents cross-context navigation confusion
✅ Improves user experience with context-aware responses
✅ Maintains separate vendor and supplier workflows
✅ Natural language commands work intuitively on both sides
