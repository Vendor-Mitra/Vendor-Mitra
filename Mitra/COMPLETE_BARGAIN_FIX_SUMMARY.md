# Complete Bargain System Fix - Summary

## 🎯 All Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Bargain on Total Amount (Not Per Kg)
**Problem**: Bargaining was on per kg price (₹50/kg) instead of total amount
**Solution**: Now bargains on total amount (₹500 for 10 kg)

### 2. ✅ Cart Updates After Deal Done
**Problem**: Cart didn't update when both parties clicked "Deal Done"
**Solution**: Cart automatically updates with bargained price in real-time

### 3. ✅ Product Stays in Cart
**Problem**: Product might be removed from cart during bargaining
**Solution**: Product remains in cart, only price updates after deal confirmation

## 📝 Files Modified

### 1. `src/pages/Cart.jsx`
- ✅ Bargain creation stores total amount (price × quantity)
