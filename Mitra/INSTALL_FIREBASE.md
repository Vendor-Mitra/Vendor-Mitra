# Quick Firebase Installation

## Step 1: Install Firebase Package

Run this command in your terminal (in the project directory):

```bash
npm install firebase
```

## Step 2: Verify Installation

Check that Firebase was added to your `package.json`:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "firebase": "^10.x.x",
  ...
}
```

## Step 3: Follow Setup Guide

After installation, follow the instructions in:
- `FIREBASE_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Complete Firebase setup
- `DATA_PERSISTENCE_SOLUTION.md` - Understanding the solution

## That's It!

Once Firebase is installed and configured, your app will automatically:
- ✅ Sync data across all devices
- ✅ Persist data in the cloud
- ✅ Update in real-time

## Without Firebase

If you don't install Firebase, the app will still work but:
- ⚠️ Data stored only in browser localStorage
- ⚠️ No cross-device sync
- ⚠️ Data lost if browser cache cleared
