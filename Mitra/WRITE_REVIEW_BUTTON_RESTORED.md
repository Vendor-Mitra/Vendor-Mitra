## Issue: Write Review Button Missing

**Problem:** The "Write Review" button that was in the Recent Orders section (Profile page) appeared to be removed or not working properly.

**Status:** ‚úÖ Button was still there, but needed updates to work with product-specific reviews

---

## Changes Made

### File: `src/pages/Profile.jsx`

#### 1. Updated Review Check Function (Lines 94-99)

**Before:**
```javascript
// Check if user has already reviewed a supplier
const hasReviewedSupplier = (supplierId) => {
  if (!user?.id) return false
  const existingReviews = reviewsDatabase.getReviewsBySupplier(supplierId)
  return existingReviews.some(review => review.vendorId === user.id)
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Check if user has already reviewed a specific product
const hasReviewedProduct = (productId) => {
  if (!user?.id) return false
  const existingReviews = reviewsDatabase.getReviewsByProduct(productId)
  return existingReviews.some(review => review.vendorId === user.id)
}
```

**Why:** Changed from checking supplier-level reviews to product-specific reviews to match the new review system.

#### 2. Enhanced Write Review Button (Lines 383-409)

**Before:**
```javascript
{/* Write Review Button for delivered orders */}
{order.status === 'delivered' && order.supplierId && !hasReviewedSupplier(order.supplierId) && (
  <button
    onClick={() => setSelectedProductForReview({
      ...product,
      orderId: order.orderId || order.id,
      supplierId: order.supplierId,
      supplierName: order.supplier
    })}
    className="text-sm bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700 text-white px-3 py-1 rounded-md font-medium mt-2 transition-colors"
  >
    ‚úçÔ∏è Write Review
  </button>
)}
```

**After:**
```javascript
{/* Write Review Button for delivered orders */}
{order.status === 'delivered' && order.supplierId && (
  <button
    onClick={() => {
      // Create unique product ID for this product
      const productId = product.id || `${order.supplierId}_${productName}`
      setSelectedProductForReview({
        id: productId,
        name: productName,
        ...product,
        orderId: order.orderId || order.id,
        supplierId: order.supplierId,
        supplierName: order.supplier
      })
    }}
    className={`text-sm px-3 py-1 rounded-md font-medium mt-2 transition-colors ${
      hasReviewedProduct(product.id || `${order.supplierId}_${productName}`)
        ? 'bg-gray-400 text-white cursor-not-allowed'
        : 'bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700 text-white'
    }`}
    disabled={hasReviewedProduct(product.id || `${order.supplierId}_${productName}`)}
  >
    {hasReviewedProduct(product.id || `${order.supplierId}_${productName}`) 
      ? '‚úì Reviewed' 
      : '‚úçÔ∏è Write Review'}
  </button>
)}
```

## New Features

**Button States:**

**Not Reviewed (Green):**
```
‚úçÔ∏è Write Review
```
- Green background
- Clickable
- Hover effect

**Already Reviewed (Gray):**
```
‚úì Reviewed
```

### 3. Smart Product ID Generation
```javascript
const productId = product.id || `${order.supplierId}_${productName}`

## How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: Order with Multiple Products

**Order from "Fresh Farms":**
- üçÖ Tomatoes (2 kg) - ‚úçÔ∏è Write Review
- üßÖ Onions (1 kg) - ‚úçÔ∏è Write Review
- ü•î Potatoes (3 kg) - ‚úçÔ∏è Write Review

**After reviewing Tomatoes:**
- üçÖ Tomatoes (2 kg) - ‚úì Reviewed (gray, disabled)
- üßÖ Onions (1 kg) - ‚úçÔ∏è Write Review (green, active)
- ü•î Potatoes (3 kg) - ‚úçÔ∏è Write Review (green, active)

### Scenario 2: Review Each Product

1. **Vendor clicks "Write Review" on Tomatoes**
   - Review modal opens for "Tomatoes"
   - Vendor writes review: "Fresh and juicy! ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
   - Submits review

2. **Button updates automatically**
   - Tomatoes button ‚Üí "‚úì Reviewed" (gray)
   - Other products still show "‚úçÔ∏è Write Review" (green)

3. **Vendor can review other products**
   - Clicks "Write Review" on Onions
   - Writes separate review for Onions
   - Each product maintains its own review
