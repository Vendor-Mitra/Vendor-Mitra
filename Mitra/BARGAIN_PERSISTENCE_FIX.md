# Bargain Chat Persistence Fix

## Issue Fixed
When clicking "Bargain" button multiple times from cart, the previous bargain chat history was being lost. Each click created a fresh bargain, deleting the old one.

## Root Cause
The cart was **always deleting old bargains** and creating new ones:

```javascript
// OLD CODE ❌
// ALWAYS start fresh - delete any existing bargains
const existingBargains = allBargains.filter(...)
if (existingBargains.length > 0) {
  // Delete all old bargains
  bargainsDatabase.bargains = filtered
}
// Always create a fresh new bargain
const bargain = bargainsDatabase.addBargain({...})
```

This meant:
1. Click "Bargain" → Creates bargain #1
2. Send messages → Chat has history
3. Click "Bargain" again → **Deletes bargain #1**, creates bargain #2
4. Chat is empty ❌

## Solution
**Reuse existing active bargains** instead of deleting them:

```javascript
// NEW CODE ✅
// Find existing ACTIVE bargain (not rejected or agreed)
let bargain = allBargains.find(b => 
  b.productId === item.id && 
  b.vendorId === vendorId && 
  b.status !== 'rejected' && 
  b.status !== 'agreed'
)

if (bargain) {
  // Reuse existing bargain ✅
  console.log('🔄 Reusing existing bargain')
} else {
  // Create new bargain only if no active one exists
  bargain = bargainsDatabase.addBargain({...})
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: First Time Bargaining
1. **Click "Bargain"** on product
2. ✅ **Creates new bargain** (no existing one)
3. **Redirects** to Bargains page
4. **Chat opens** (empty)
5. **Send messages** → Chat has history

### Scenario 2: Clicking Bargain Again
1. **Click "Bargain"** on same product
2. ✅ **Finds existing bargain** (status: pending)
3. ✅ **Reuses it** (doesn't delete)
4. **Redirects** to Bargains page
5. **Chat opens** with **previous messages** ✅

### Scenario 3: After Deal Done
1. **Complete bargain** (status: agreed)
2. **Click "Bargain"** again
3. ✅ **Creates new bargain** (old one is "agreed", not active)
4. **Fresh chat** for new negotiation

### Scenario 4: After Rejection
1. **Reject bargain** (status: rejected)
2. **Click "Bargain"** again
3. ✅ **Creates new bargain** (old one is "rejected", not active)
4. **Fresh chat** for new attempt

```

### Creating New Bargain

## Active vs Inactive Bargains

### Active Bargains (Reused)

- ✅ `status: 'accepted'` - Both accepted, waiting for "Deal Done"

### Inactive Bargains (New One Created)
- ❌ `status: 'agreed'` - Deal is done, bargain complete
- ❌ `status: 'rejected'` - Offer was rejected, start fresh
