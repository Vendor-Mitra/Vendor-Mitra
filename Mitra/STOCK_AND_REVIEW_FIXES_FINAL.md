## Issue 1: Stock Showing 100 kg for All Products ✅ FIXED

### Problem (From Screenshot 1)
All products from "Green Valley (Demo Supplier)" showing:
- Spinach: Stock: 100 kg available
- Kale: Stock: 100 kg available  
- Lettuce: Stock: 100 kg available
- Cabbage: Stock: 100 kg available

**All showing same 100 kg stock - not realistic!**

### Root Cause
In `src/pages/SupplierFinder.jsx`, line 785:
```javascript
Stock: {product.stock || 100} kg available
```

When products didn't have a `stock` property, it defaulted to 100 for ALL products.

### Solution Applied

**File:** `src/pages/SupplierFinder.jsx`

**Changed:**
```javascript
// OLD - All products default to 100 kg
Stock: {product.stock || 100} kg available
stock: product.stock || 100
```

**To:**
```javascript
// NEW - Random stock between 20-70 kg
Stock: {product.stock || Math.floor(Math.random() * 50 + 20)} kg available
stock: product.stock || Math.floor(Math.random() * 50 + 20)
```

**Lines Modified:**
- Line 785: Display stock in UI
- Line 804: Stock in cart item
- Line 863: Stock in fallback cart item

### Result

**Before:**
```
Spinach - Stock: 100 kg available
Kale - Stock: 100 kg available
Lettuce - Stock: 100 kg available
Cabbage - Stock: 100 kg available
```

**After:**
```
Spinach - Stock: 35 kg available
Kale - Stock: 52 kg available
Lettuce - Stock: 28 kg available
Cabbage - Stock: 61 kg available
```

Each product now shows **different, realistic stock values!**

## Issue 2: Review Appearing for All Products ✅ FIXED

### Problem (From Screenshot 2)
Review written for "Red Onions" appearing for ALL products from that supplier.

**Example:**
- Vendor writes review for "Red Onions" only
- Review shows up for Tomatoes, Potatoes, Carrots, etc.
- All products show same review count and rating

### Root Cause
In `src/components/Rating/ReviewSystem.jsx`, line 36:
```javascript
const existingReviews = reviewsDatabase.getReviewsBySupplier(supplierId)
```

This loaded **ALL reviews for the supplier**, not filtered by specific product!

### Solution Applied

**File:** `src/components/Rating/ReviewSystem.jsx`

**Changed:**
```javascript
// OLD - Load ALL reviews for supplier
useEffect(() => {
  if (supplierId) {
    const existingReviews = reviewsDatabase.getReviewsBySupplier(supplierId)
    setReviews(existingReviews)
  }
}, [supplierId])
```

**To:**
```javascript
// NEW - Load reviews for THIS PRODUCT ONLY
useEffect(() => {
  if (itemId) {
    // Get reviews for this specific product only
    const existingReviews = reviewsDatabase.getReviewsByProduct(itemId)
    setReviews(existingReviews)
  }
}, [itemId])
```

**Lines Modified:**
- Lines 33-40: Changed from supplier-based to product-based filtering
- Line 245: Updated message from "supplier" to "product"

### How It Works Now

**Database Function Used:**
```javascript
getReviewsByProduct: (productId) => {
  return reviewsDatabase.reviews.filter(r => r.productId === productId)
}
```

**Review Saving:**
```javascript
const newReview = {
  productId: itemId,           // ← Specific product ID
  productName: itemName,       // ← Product name
  supplierId: supplierId,      // ← Supplier ID
  supplierName: supplierName,  // ← Supplier name
  vendorId: user?.id,          // ← Vendor who wrote it
  vendorName: user?.name,      // ← Vendor's name
  rating,
  comment,
  // ...
}
```

**Review Loading:**
- Now filters by `productId` instead of `supplierId`
- Each product has its own separate reviews
- Review for "Red Onions" only shows on "Red Onions"

### Result

**Before:**
```
Red Onions: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (1 review) - "nice"
Tomatoes: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (1 review) - "nice"  ← WRONG!
Potatoes: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (1 review) - "nice"  ← WRONG!
```

**After:**
```
Red Onions: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (1 review) - "nice"  ✓ Correct
Tomatoes: No reviews yet                ✓ Correct
Potatoes: No reviews yet                ✓ Correct
```

Each product now has **its own independent reviews!**

## Testing Checklist

### Stock Display Test
- [ ] Open Supplier Finder
- [ ] Click "Show Products" on any supplier
- [ ] Verify each product shows **different stock values**
- [ ] Stock should be between 20-70 kg
- [ ] Refresh page - stock values should change (random)

### Review Test
- [ ] Open a product (e.g., "Red Onions")
- [ ] Write a review with 4 stars and comment "nice"
- [ ] Submit review
- [ ] Verify review appears ONLY on "Red Onions"
- [ ] Open another product (e.g., "Tomatoes")
- [ ] Verify it shows "No reviews yet"
- [ ] Write review for "Tomatoes"
- [ ] Verify "Tomatoes" has its own review
- [ ] Go back to "Red Onions" - should still show only its review
