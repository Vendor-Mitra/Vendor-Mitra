# How to Use the Bargaining Feature - Step by Step

## Understanding the Bargaining Flow

The Accept/Reject buttons **only appear when the OTHER side has sent you an offer**. This is by design to prevent you from accepting your own offer.

## Complete Bargaining Workflow

### Scenario 1: Vendor Initiates Bargaining

#### Step 1: Vendor Starts the Bargain
1. Login as **Vendor** (manya@gmail.com / manya123)
2. Go to **Supplier Finder** or **Find Items**
3. Add a product to cart (e.g., "Organic Tomatoes" at ₹100/kg)
4. Go to **Cart** page
5. Click **"Bargain"** button next to the product
6. You'll see the bargain chat modal open

#### Step 2: Vendor Sends Initial Offer
- The chat will show a blue tip: "💡 Start by sending your offer price"
- Type your offer in the input box, for example:
  - `"150"` or
  - `"I can pay 150"` or
  - `"Can you do 150?"`
- Click **Send**
- You'll see a **yellow message**: "⏳ Waiting for supplier to respond to your offer of ₹150"
- **No Accept/Reject buttons yet** - this is correct! You're waiting for the supplier's response

#### Step 3: Supplier Responds
1. Open another browser (or incognito window)
2. Login as **Supplier** (sakshi07@gmail.com / sakshi123)
3. Go to **Supplier Dashboard**
4. Click **"Bargains"** tab
5. You'll see the bargain request from the vendor
6. Click **"Open Chat"**
7. You'll see the vendor's offer of ₹150
8. **NOW YOU SEE ACCEPT/REJECT BUTTONS!** ✅
   - "Supplier offered ₹150"
   - **Accept ₹150** button (green)
   - **Reject** button (red)

#### Step 4: Supplier Can Counter-Offer or Accept
**Option A: Supplier Accepts**
- Click **"Accept ₹150"**
- Status changes to "Supplier Accepted - Waiting for Vendor"
- Vendor needs to confirm

**Option B: Supplier Counter-Offers**
- Type a counter-offer: `"180"` or `"Best I can do is 180"`
- Click **Send**
- Now the vendor will see Accept/Reject buttons for ₹180

#### Step 5: Vendor Responds to Counter-Offer
1. Back to vendor's browser
2. Go to **"Bargains"** page (from navigation menu)
3. Click **"Open Chat"** on the bargain
4. You'll see the supplier's counter-offer of ₹180
5. **NOW YOU SEE ACCEPT/REJECT BUTTONS!** ✅
   - "Supplier offered ₹180"
   - **Accept ₹180** button (green)
   - **Reject** button (red)

#### Step 6: Both Sides Accept
1. Vendor clicks **"Accept ₹180"**
2. Status shows: "You Accepted - Waiting for Supplier"
3. Supplier clicks **"Accept ₹180"** (or already accepted)
4. Status changes to **"Both Accepted"**
5. **"Deal Done"** button appears (green) ✅

#### Step 7: Finalize the Deal
1. Either vendor or supplier clicks **"Deal Done"**
2. Bargain is complete!
3. Vendor goes to **Cart**
4. Product now shows:
   - ~~₹100~~ (original price, strikethrough)
   - **₹180** (bargained price in green)
   - **"Bargained!"** label
5. Click **"Buy Now"** to purchase at the bargained price

## Why Don't I See Accept/Reject Buttons?

### Common Scenarios:

#### ❌ "I opened the chat but no buttons appear"
**Reason**: No one has sent an offer yet, OR you're looking at your own offer
**Solution**: 
- If chat is empty: Send an offer first (type a number like "150")
- If you see your own offer: Wait for the other side to respond
- You'll see a yellow message: "⏳ Waiting for [other side] to respond"

#### ❌ "I sent an offer but can't accept it myself"
**Reason**: You can't accept your own offer - only the other side can
**Solution**: Wait for the other side (vendor or supplier) to respond

#### ❌ "The supplier sent an offer but I don't see buttons"
**Reason**: You might be looking at an old bargain or the page didn't refresh
**Solution**: 
- Close and reopen the chat
- Refresh the page
- Make sure you're in the correct bargain (check product name)

#### ✅ "I see the buttons!"
**What you should see**:
```
Supplier offered ₹180
[Accept ₹180]  [Reject]
```
or
```
Vendor offered ₹150
[Accept ₹150]  [Reject]
```

## Pro Tips

1. **Always include a number in your message** for it to be recognized as an offer
   - ✅ "150", "I can pay 150", "How about 150?"
   - ❌ "Can we negotiate?", "Lower price please"

2. **The last numeric offer is what gets accepted**
   - If vendor offers 150, then supplier offers 180, accepting means accepting 180

3. **Both sides must accept the SAME price**
   - Vendor accepts 180 → Supplier must also accept 180
   - If supplier changes mind, they can send a new offer

4. **Bargained prices persist across login/logout**
   - Once you click "Deal Done", the price is saved
   - You can logout and login, the bargained price stays in your cart

5. **Cart items also persist**
   - Your cart items stay even after logout
   - They only clear when you complete a purchase
