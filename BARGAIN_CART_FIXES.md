# Bargain & Cart Fixes - Testing Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Cart Persistence Across Login/Logout ✅
- **Problem**: Cart items disappeared when logging out and logging back in
- **Solution**: Cart now persists in localStorage and is NOT cleared on logout
- **Behavior**: Cart items only disappear when you complete a purchase (Buy Now)

### 2. Accept/Reject Buttons in Vendor Bargains ✅
- **Problem**: No accept/reject buttons in vendor's "Your Bargains" page
- **Solution**: Added full Negotiation component with accept/reject functionality
- **Behavior**: 
  - Vendor can now accept/reject offers in "Your Bargains" page
  - When vendor accepts, the bargained price is saved
  - The bargained price automatically appears in the cart

### 3. Bargained Price Display in Cart ✅
- **Problem**: Bargained prices weren't showing in cart after acceptance
- **Solution**: Shared localStorage (`vendorMitraBargainedPrices`) between Bargains page and Cart page
- **Behavior**: 
  - When you accept a bargain (from either "Your Bargains" or Cart's bargain modal), the price is saved
  - The cart automatically shows the bargained price with strikethrough on original price
  - You can buy with the bargained amount

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. `src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx` - Removed cart clearing on logout
2. `src/pages/Bargains.jsx` - Added Negotiation component with callbacks
3. `src/pages/Cart.jsx` - Load bargained prices from shared localStorage
4. `src/data/userDatabase.js` - Added vendor/supplier acceptance flags
5. `src/components/Bargain/Negotiation.jsx` - Fixed accept/reject logic

### Shared State
- **Cart Items**: `vendorMitraCart` in localStorage
- **Bargained Prices**: `vendorMitraBargainedPrices` in localStorage
- **Bargain Records**: `vendorMitraBargains` in localStorage

### Status Flow
1. **Pending**: Initial state, no one has accepted
2. **Vendor Accepted**: Vendor accepted, waiting for supplier
3. **Supplier Accepted**: Supplier accepted, waiting for vendor
4. **Both Accepted** (status='accepted'): Both sides accepted, ready for "Deal Done"
5. **Deal Done** (status='agreed'): Final confirmation, bargain complete
6. **Rejected**: Either side rejected the offer

## Notes
- Bargained prices persist across login/logout
- Cart items persist across login/logout
- Both are only cleared when you complete a purchase
- Accept/Reject buttons only show when there's a numeric offer from the other side
- "Deal Done" only shows when both sides have accepted
